// leetCode 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

/*

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

func TwoSum(numbers []int, target int) []int {
	if len(numbers) == 1 || len(numbers) == 0 {
		return []int{}
	}

	l, r := 0, len(numbers)-1

	for l < r {
		sum := numbers[l] + numbers[r]
		if sum == target {
			return []int{l + 1, r + 1}
		}

		r--
		if l == r {
			r = len(numbers) - 1
			l++
		}
	}
	return []int{}
